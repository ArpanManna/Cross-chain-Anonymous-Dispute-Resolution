# Justice Protocol

In decentralized world, the need for transparent, secure, and fair dispute resolution and governance mechanisms is important. Traditional voting platforms often face challenges like lack of transparency, potential for manipulation, and limited accessibility. The blockchain, with its inherent properties of immutability and transparency, offers a solution to these challenges. However, implementing a reliable and decentralized voting system on the blockchain involves several complexities, especially when integrating external data and ensuring cross-chain compatibility can add value to the community.

## Project Description

The Justice Protocol aims to develop a fair and transparent cross-chain anonymous dispute resolution process. Existing disputes/ voting is limited to a single chain. If any disputes arises on Ethereum, only users from Ethereum is able to particiapte in the resolution lifecycle. Justice Protocol removes this barrier by including users from any chains.

## Features

1. **Cross-Chain Voting Capability**: Utilizing Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), Justice Protocol allows for voting across different blockchain networks, enhancing accessibility and participation.  

2. **Anonymous Voting**: Justice Protocol uses Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Functions) to bring anonymity is dispute resolution. Each contributor is cryptographically anonymous until resolution is completed.

3. **Transparent Voting Process**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and enabling participants to verify the integrity of the voting process.

4. **Automated Ballot Count**: At the end of the resolution period, the protocol automatically tallies votes and declares the result based on voter's randomness provided, ensuring a quick and unbiased outcome.

## Use Cases

- Disputes in Escrow services
- Governance Disputes

- Disputes in Token Listing
- Disputes in IP rights
- Disputes in Asset Ownerships
